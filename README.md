### Prompt 1

Describe the conversations you had this sprint with your product owner(s) and team.

- Describe the product and features you plan to deliver.
The application we are creating is meant to be a one-stop-shop for tenants and landlords to handle all property chores and work orders. Three of the biggest features we have discussed is adding the ability to upload forms and documents, a messaging add-on, as well as implementing Stripe to handle payments.

- How did these conversations determine the features you will deliver during Labs?
Through our conversation we nit picked some of the finer details of the app and found a lot of missing parts and functionalities. This caused us to change course and schedule time to bring the app up to par before getting to the greater features.

- How did your discussions change the way you viewed the product?
Originally we wanted to track all expenses and incoming revenue. However, we then discussed the difficulty of a full fledged accounting app and decided to aim for more of a basic approach to the expenses solution. Instead of having a full quick books style app, it will just track basic expenses and revenue.

### Prompt 2

Describe the technical or design discussions that shaped the long-term product vision.

- **For data scientists and engineers:** Describe the technologies that you will use to build this product. Why do they fit the product vision?
- **For UX designers:** Describe the questions that you are asking during user research. Why have you selected these questions to ask? What is the problem your team is trying to solve?

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Journal Entry grade. Skipping this section _will_ prevent you from passing this challenge.
